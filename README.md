# Developer Guidelines

Welcome! Here are the rules and best practices to follow when working on this project:

## 📝 1. Always Work from an Issue

- **Never start coding without an Issue!**
- If you want to add a feature, fix a bug, or improve something, create an Issue first.

## 💬 2. Use the Issue Conversation

- **Document your progress in the Issue conversation.**
- Comment on the Issue as you work, even if you’re working solo.  
  (English is cool, but what matters is keeping track!)

## 🌱 3. Create a Branch per Issue

- **Each Issue should have its own branch.**
- Name your branch after the Issue, e.g.:  
  `feature/issue-12-login-page` or `fix/issue-7-bug-typo`
- This helps keep the code organized and makes reviews easier.

## 📊 4. Update the Project Board

- **Move Issues on the project board as you work:**
  - To do → In progress → Done
- Keep the board up to date to show what’s being worked on and what’s done.
